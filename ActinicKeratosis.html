        <h2>ACTINIC KERATOSIS</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p><br><h4>Definition:</h4>Actinic keratosis, often abbreviated as AK, is a common skin condition characterized by the presence of small, scaly, and rough patches of skin. It is considered a precancerous lesion due to its potential to develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a type of skin cancer, if left untreated.

        <br><h4>Cause:</h4> Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds is the primary cause of actinic keratosis. Fair-skinned individuals and those with a history of sunburns are at higher risk.

        <h4><br>Common Symptoms of Actinic Keratosis:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rough or Scaly Patches: AK lesions typically appear as small, rough or scaly patches of skin. They often feel dry to the touch and can be easily felt with your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Color Variations: These patches can vary in color, including pink, red, brown, or flesh-colored. The color may change or become more pronounced over time.</li>
            <li>Itching or Burning Sensation: Some people with actinic keratosis experience mild itching or a burning sensation in the affected areas.</li>
            <li>Tenderness: The patches may sometimes be tender or sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>Size and Texture Changes: Over time, AK lesions can grow larger, become thicker, and develop a more rough and wart-like texture.</li>
            <li>Bleeding or Crusting: In some cases, actinic keratosis lesions can become irritated and bleed or crust over.</li>
            <li>Location: Actinic keratosis is commonly found on areas of the skin that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips.</li>
        </ul>
        It's essential to note that while actinic keratosis itself is not cancerous, it has the potential to progress into skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) if left untreated. Therefore, if you suspect you have actinic keratosis or notice any of these symptoms, it's crucial to seek medical evaluation and appropriate treatment, especially if you have risk factors such as fair skin, a history of sunburns, or significant sun exposure. Early detection and treatment can help prevent the development of skin cancer.
