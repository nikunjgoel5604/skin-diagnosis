 <p><br><h4>Definition:</h4>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops in the melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin. It is the most serious form of skin cancer because it can spread to other parts of the body if not detected and treated early. Here is some basic information about melanoma and its common symptoms:

    <br><h4>Cause:</h4>Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation: Exposure to UV radiation from the sun or artificial sources, such as tanning beds, is a significant risk factor for melanoma.

    Skin Type: Individuals with fair skin, light-colored eyes, and a history of sunburns are at a higher risk.
    
    Family History: Having a family member with melanoma increases the risk.
    
    Moles: The presence of a large number of moles or atypical (unusual) moles can raise the risk.
    
    Weakened Immune System: A weakened immune system due to conditions like HIV or organ transplantation can increase the risk.
    
    <h4><br>Common Symptoms of Dermatofibroma:</h4>

    Melanoma can develop on any part of the body, including areas not exposed to the sun. It can also arise from existing moles. Common symptoms and signs of melanoma include:

Change in a Mole: The appearance of a new mole or a change in the size, shape, color, or elevation of an existing mole can be a warning sign.

Asymmetry: Melanomas are often asymmetrical, meaning one half looks different from the other half.

Irregular Borders: The borders of a melanoma may be irregular, notched, or poorly defined.

Varied Colors: Melanomas can have multiple colors within the same lesion, such as shades of brown, black, blue, red, or white.

Diameter: While melanomas can be small, they are often larger than 6 millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser).

Evolving or Changing: Any mole or skin lesion that changes over time, including itching, bleeding, or crusting, should be evaluated.

Pain or Sensation: Some melanomas may be painful or cause unusual sensations, although this is less common.

Spreading: Melanoma can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs, causing symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or unexplained weight loss.

Nail Changes: Melanoma can develop under a nail, causing dark lines or streaks. This is known as subungual melanoma.
